LIFTI is a simple to use netstandard2 compatible in-memory full text indexing API.

If you are building an application that refers to objects that contain lots of text, and you:

<ol type="a">
<li>Don't want to store all the text in memory all the time (e.g. files or other text-based resources)</li>
<li>Want to be able to search the contents of the text quickly</li>
</ol>

Then LIFTI is for you. You could use it in:

* Client applications, e.g. Blazor, UWP, Xamarin, WPF, Uno Platform
* ASP.NET applications where you need to perform a fast search against a long list of words. An in-memory index of exclusion words
could easily be used to do this.
* Lots of other scenarios!
